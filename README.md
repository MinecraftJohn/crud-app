  <h1>CRUD Application</h1>

### What is this?

This project is called crud (create, read, update, and delete) the four basic functionality that manipulate data in a database that is important to any web applicationâ€™s basic functionality.

With this challenge I learn more a lot with setInterval() to display a toast message. Displaying a message when there's no data available and form validation. This project was my first programming challenge/task that was given by my mentor from my internship company. I also engage more at Figma with this project because I had to make a logo out.
