This project was a challenge of my mentor from my on job training company<br>
<br>
This was the first programming challenge/task that was given to me while I'm on internship. This project is called CRUD, these are the four basic functions that models should be able to do, at most. What you see in the picture where data is being displayed is the READ function (I struggled so much in here xD). When you open the add new button a form will pop-up where you can enter a data to insert into database, this is called the CREATE function. UPDATE and DELETE was also implemented and is working fine :D
